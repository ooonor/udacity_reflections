When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    Always, almost.  As long as it's not sensitive/classified, it is a way to have a backup for safety.
    Also, if you are working on the same code with another person, it makes it easy to share and collaborate
    Or simply if you work on two different computers at home, or need to borrow someone else's computer to work.
